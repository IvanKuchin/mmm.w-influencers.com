# DJ Don Davis

DJ Don Davis is one of the most interactive and enjoyable DJ/MCs in all of New England and handles each client with extreme consideration and courtesy. 

Years of experience have honed his instincts, allowing him to read a crowd like a well-worn book. He sees not just bodies on the dance floor, but a kaleidoscope of desires, rhythms waiting to be awakened. But Don’s magic lies not just in the music. He’s a master of the show, a conductor of collective euphoria. His infectious energy radiates from the booth, his smile as wide as the bassline. Don utilizes his knowledge of music and events to play a unique open format style that incorporates all ages and genres, keeping your guests there for the duration of the evening. That’s the power of Don Davis. He’s more than a DJ; he’s a pioneer of pure unadulterated fun.
