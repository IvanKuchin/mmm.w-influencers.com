# About

Boston Mix and Mingle Singles Speed Dating 20's and 30's-Mixer Scholars

Join us for a fun-filled evening of speed dating and mingling with other singles in their 20's and 30's at the Scholars American Bistro and Cocktail Lounge in Boston, MA, USA. This exciting event will take place on Thursday, March 7, 2024 starting at 6:30 PM (Eastern Standard Time).

Whether you're looking for a potential partner or simply want to expand your social circle, this event offers the perfect opportunity to meet new people in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Our speed dating sessions will provide you with the chance to engage in short, one-on-one conversations with other singles, allowing you to quickly connect and determine if there's a spark.

# What to expect

The evening will commence with a very brief dedicated networking session, allowing participants to meet and engage with industry peers, thought leaders, and potential collaborators. Structured activities and an ice-breaker game will segue into a much more relaxed time of food, drink and cheering on the Fisher Cats.

After the speed dating rounds, the fun continues with a mixer where you can freely mingle, chat, and get to know other attendees better. The Scholars American Bistro and Cocktail Lounge offers a cozy and inviting setting, perfect for socializing and enjoying delicious food and drinks.

Don't miss out on this exciting event! Grab your friends, put on your best outfit, and get ready to mix, mingle, and potentially find a connection. Sign up now to secure your spot and get ready for a night of laughter, great conversations, and new connections!
